Problem:
Currently my aunt’s restaurant is the only restaurant located in Upstate South Carolina, and the only way she is able to get traction is through word of mouth and Facebook. With no means of having someone to build a website, she has only been relying on resources that she’s familiar with. Another issue being is that there is no one currently at her shop that can take on the added responsibility of maintaining the website. However with the website, customers can share more and see more about what the restaurant does, the foods they make, and the events they plan. Ideally, we would be able to build a website or web app that can be easily maintained and accessed for customers to go to.

Goals:
Integrate Facebook with the website
Integrate/Register other food delivery services so that food can be delivered
Provide a way for customers to view other services such as event planning and catering
Make the website easily maintainable to ensure the maintenance is smooth for someone not familiar with technology
Creating an Administrator component or external feature so employees can keep track of orders

Objectives:
Make sure that the website has at least 4 sections: About + Contact Us/Menu/Other Services
Use Doordash or Uber Eats for Pickup
Make sure that the website can be viewed on mobile (so possibly created a web app instead)

(Ideal) Budget (~$1000)
WebHosting + Domain + Other Features ~$216 for 3 years downpayment + $400 after first two years
$94/year social integration
$80/month food delivery + “white label ordering” + point of sales systems integration 
~ $200 miscellaneous expenditures


I don’t really have too much success with working in integration and restaurants but I have had experience building a webapp from backend to frontend for my internship using Blazor Client side/Server side app.
