## Completing Navbar and Header
I've been able to complete the navbar. While styling is something I'm still concerned about given the timeline, I am priotizing completion at the moment. Like I've referred to earlier, I've never used React before so even the debugging process is new to me. I had an issue with the responsiveness when the site shrinks in size but I was able to resolve it. I also was able to resolve a little bit of the navbar design so it aligned more with my mockup. Also my header was a lot simpler but the code was a bit complicated so I had to sift through it. It's also very convenient that you can copy stylign from figma which has really worked with following the mockup.

### Some new ideas
While following this tutorial new things that come to mind for a later iteration including signing users up for news about the restaurant. 

## Next Steps
I need to work more on embedding content on the homepage and following more of the tutorial to understand more of how I can interact with mutliple pages which I believe won't be too difficult. Then I'll move on to the next pages.
