## Delivery Service Research
[ToastTab Research](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/third-party-delivery-service)

[Uber Eats](https://merchants.ubereats.com/us/en/services/online-ordering/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20set%20up,want%20to%20activate%20for%20Webshop.)

It seems like there is a pricing for using Uber Eats

[DoorDash](https://get.doordash.com/en-us/products)

Need to create an account in order to get the pricing (I need to discuss with my client more and get more business information)

[Grubhub](https://get.grubhub.com/grubhub-pricing-and-fees/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=National+%7C+Brand+%7C++GFR&utm_term=grubhub%20for%20restaurants&utm_content=acct_id-9867381046:camp_id-12015705480:adgroup_id-120027745601:kwd-299462946130:creative_id-502313998713:ext_id-:matchtype_id-e:network-g:device-c:loc_interest-:loc_physical-9073502&gclid=CjwKCAiAuaKfBhBtEiwAht6H7w_-6llowEoXQ0Q_dJzkDLw3UeHdlEioMPnHUhRE7a6Ge26or-OPsxoCVqMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

Grubhub seems very beneficial so far not requiring too much maintenance on our end which would be good for the long run. 

It seems like Doordash is the most popular option and the Grubhub least popular but more research must be done for Greenville, South Carolina
